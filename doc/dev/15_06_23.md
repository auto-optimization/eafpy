# read_datasets -> Getting correct path 
I have tried `appending os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` before the filename to get the filename to point to the correct script, but this just points to the folder of the `eaf.py` script

Behaviour Without appending a path (just using local path with filename)
* This works using python interpreter, when it is opened in the same folder
* I can also go into a parent folder and find the relative path using the interpeter
* It is also working if I just run test_eaf.py
* However, it is not working in tox, it cannot find the file

#### os.path
We can use `os.listdir()` to list all the directories in the current path. This can help to work out where the files are in the virtual environment that tox creates
* Tox opens in the root of the virtual environment, which makes sense. In tests.py I set the path as  `tests/test_data/read_datasets.dat` and this solves the issue

# Sorted TODO from yesterday
* [x] Fix build issues with windows
* [x] Sort out testing after package builds 
* [x] Fix path for read_datasets
