# Problem working out how to import C extension
I have not worked out how to import the C extension in the eaf.py file, after the package is built I have tried numerous different types of import eg `import c_binding`, `from . import c_binding`, `import eafpy.c_binding` etc. I thought the solution might be realated to not building the package fully with CFFI so I will attempt to build with setuptools.


# Trying to build with CFFI
I have been attempting to build the project with CFFI but am getting issues with the c_binding.so file not importing when I try to use eaf.py after the package installs. I have just being using `python -m build` with setuptools and the pyproject.toml, however CFFI does not support the .toml, so I am attempting to add the `setup.py` configuration.

I have been getting an issue when the setup.py file to build CFFI where it cannot find the io.h header, I have been exploring different settings for the compilation such as adding an `include_dirs = [os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))]) ` to the build_cffi.py file,
