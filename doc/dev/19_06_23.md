# TODO today:
[ ] Work on getting fpli_hv() in hv.h function working in python
[ ] Read through differrent plotting libraries

# fpli_hv -> Calculate hypervolume
`double fpli_hv(const double *data, int d, int n, const double *ref)`

`X[X[:,2] == 1, :2]` -> Select dataset 1, only selecting objectives. It is array with shape (num data points, num objectives)  
`ref = np.array([10, 10])` -> Data points match the dimension of one point from the dataset eg. the shape is `(1, num_objs)`

`d` represents the number of objectives, whereas `N` represents the number of points.

From the R project documentation: 
```
Computes the hypervolume contribution of each point given a set of points
#' with respect to a given reference point assuming minimization of all
#' objectives.  Dominated points have zero contribution. Duplicated points have
#' zero contribution even if not dominated, because removing one of them does
#' not change the hypervolume dominated by the remaining set.
```

What parameters do we need in C wrapper vs CFFI wrapper?
* We can get shape from numpy in Python wrapper.
* How to input numpy array to CFFI wrapper?
* Need to map 2d array input to 1d array in C wrapper

Need to map the shape of ref and data to the C `fpli_hv` function. 
We need to check the shape of the ref and compare to data shape.

# CFFI with numpy inputs
Use `aptr = ffi.cast("double *", ffi.from_buffer(a))`, `a` is a numpy array.




Still TODO:
1. Setupt codecov
2. Add pre-commit ci to reformat code if it fails black checks
3. Sphinx Documentation
4. Jupiter Documentation
