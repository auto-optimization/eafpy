#Python packaging

Eg. 
packaging_tutorial
* src\
   *  example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/
        * \__init__.py
        *  example.py
- Directory containing the python should match the package name
- Init.py is required to denote as a package


### Packages + submodules
When importing a package, python looks through all packages on `sys.path` looking for the sub-directory
#### Package layout example

```
sound/                          Top-level package
      __init__.py               Initialize the sound package
      formats/                  
              __init__.py
              wavread.py
              wavwrite.py
              aiffread.py
              aiffwrite.py
              auread.py
              auwrite.py
              ...
      effects/                  Subpackage for sound effects
              __init__.py
              echo.py
              surround.py
              reverse.py
```
Each sub-module requires its own init.py file. Reference them using 
eg `import sound.formats.wavread`
You can also use `from sound.formats import wavread` so now you can do `wavread.read()` instead of typing the full name

## pyproject.toml
Is a file used by packaging tools eg `pip` and `build` to describe what backend tool is used to create distribution packages forthe project. These icluding `hatchling`, `setuptools`, `Flit` and `PDM`.

Example ->
```
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```
## Metadata
Used to describe the package and add data including name, version, description, python version.


# Questions
* What license to use -> Leave empty for now 
* Can we include the eaf C library in the package? Yes

# More advanced Packaging
Poetry is a toold for python package management that can simplify creating full packages. It is kind of like Conda but it is python specific.

The actions can be completed with pip in the same way

# Github actions
We want to complete the following steps using github actions every time a commit is completed:
1. Run the tests
2. Build the project for Windows, Linux, MacOS
