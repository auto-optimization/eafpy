# Adding linter to GH actions
A linter is a tool used to analyse + highlight errors in coding style. Some examples include
* Pylint
* Flake8
* Black

I will use Black to format the code by adding a github action job. I am trying to work out how to first lint the code, and then run the tests on the linted-changes.

# Pre-commit hooks
I had a mistaken understanding of how linting should work with github actions, I thought I could do the linting in github actions and it would make changes to the commit. However, I don't think it can be done like this - the linting in the CI is just used to check. In order to automatically do linting every commit we need to configure a `pre-commit hook`, which is basically just a script that is run before a commit is processed.
We can do this using the pre-commit package. After installing a pre-commit, we create a file called `pre-commit-config.yaml`, I can just copy the configuration specified in the [Black documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/source_version_control.html). Next
