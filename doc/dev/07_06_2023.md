# Adding linter to GH actions
A linter is a tool used to analyse + highlight errors in coding style. Some examples include
* Pylint
* Flake8
* Black

I will use Black to format the code by adding a github action job. I am trying to work out how to first lint the code, and then run the tests on the linted-changes.
