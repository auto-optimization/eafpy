# Choose plotting library
At the moment the objective is to plot the datasets and attainment surfaces in 2d. I need to compare different plotting libraries and tools

How to plot? 

I am thinking to have overloaded plotting functions like this:

def plot_dataset(filename):

def plot_dataset(np_array):

it would look like this 


def plot_dataset(filename = None, np_array=None)
    if filename:
        dataset = eaf.read_datasets("filename")
    if np_array:

## Other packages
__altair__ 
__+__ altair has some cool features for fairly easy adding interactive plots such as linking together, without needing a python server - see example in [this](https://mathdatasimplified.com/2023/06/05/top-6-python-libraries-for-visualization-which-one-to-use/) article.
__-__ harder to make graphs as aesthetic

__bokeh__
__+__ Adds upon matplotlib, including adding higher level api and more interactivity, linking graphs together etc.    
__-__ Still needs more code than other libraries, and is also harder to make plots aesthetic

__folium__
Only really relevant to maps

#### Bokeh vs Plotly
* Bokeh seems to have a more efficient web backend, but has slightly more complex syntax
* Plotly offers a lot better support for 3d graphs and simple syntax, but may be less efficient for large datasets
* Both tools offer static plots also

I think I will go with plotly because I am more familiar with it, and it has better support for 3d graphing 

### Plotly express scatter
Plotly express provides a simpler high level interface for plotly compared to the graph object library.
