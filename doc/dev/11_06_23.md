# Attemts with pybind11
It seems that pybind11 may be the wrong route -> It does not natively support functions with double pointers, so more c++ code is required. Also, changes from c to C++ are required. I attempted to make a workaround in c++ for using double pointers for the read_double_data function, it compiled but produced a segmentation fault when running. I will attempt with CFFI

# Caling the read_double_data function
Trying to understand the read_double_data function in C so I can understand the data types required
